# Brief Reverse Correlation Task

Run the Brief Reverse Correlation Task locally or online.

To run locally, simply save the HTML file of the experiment toagether with the 'images' folder containing the task stimuli in the same folder. To start the experiment, simply open the html file in your internet browser. Once you complete the experiment, it will save the results in your browser's default downloads directory (usually a folder called Downloads).

I included two versions of the experiment:

-   **Standard version:** demo_briefrc_12_ENG.html

-   **Version including stimulus counterbalancing checks**: demo_filename_check_briefrc_12_ENG.html

The version allowing counterbalancing checks shows the filenames of the image files in all trials. This version should be used to run checks on your experiment. It allows you to verify how many original and inverted noise patches of the same pair are presented in a trial, or to check the number of different pairs of images are displayed in a trial, or if there are any repetitions of files, etc. Besides displaying the image filenames in the trials, this experiment is in every way identical to the standard one.

## Face Stimuli

Noise patches superimposed on the base face were generated using the rcicr R package (Dotsch, 2016). The base face is the composite image of the average male face and of the average female face with neutral expression of the Karolinska Face Database (Lundqvist & Litton, 1998).
